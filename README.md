# Project Euler C++

This contains the solutions to Project Euler problems 1-77 solved in C++

### About

From the Project Euler website:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than 
> just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, 
> the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
> 
> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind 
> to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

### Development

Delevolpment was started on June of 2015. I orginally started Project Euler in 2013 with Java. Since then I had gained
a lot more experience with C++ I wanted to try the Project Euler problems again. Because it had been two years since I 
originally solved the problems, I had forgot how I did the problems the first time so started fresh.
